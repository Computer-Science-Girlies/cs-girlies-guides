# 💖 Contributing to Computer Science Girlies 👩💻

Thank you for considering contributing to one of our projects!  
We're so excited to welcome new contributors — whether it's your first time or your fiftieth. 🙌

This guide will walk you through **how we work**, how to **set up your environment**, and how to **submit contributions** (code, docs, ideas — all are welcome!).

## 🧁 What Can I Contribute?

There’s *so* much you can help with! Just a few ideas:

- ✨ New features or enhancements
- 🐛 Bug fixes
- 📝 Improving documentation
- 🧪 Writing tests
- 💡 Opening issues for bugs or ideas
- 🎨 Design or UI suggestions
- 🔗 Sharing helpful resources (especially for beginners!)

No contribution is too small. Every bit of help matters. 💛

## 🛠️ Setting Up

If you haven’t already, check out the [`CONTRIBUTE_GUIDE.md`](./CONTRIBUTE_GUIDE.md) for a gentle walkthrough.

Summarized (and basic) setup steps:
1. Fork the repo
2. Clone it locally
3. Create a branch
4. Make your changes
5. Commit + push
6. Open a Pull Request (PR)

### 🔍 Naming Your Branch

Use something descriptive like:

- `fix-typo-footer`
- `add-dark-mode`
- `update-readme-links`

---

## 📢 Opening a Pull Request (PR)

When your changes are ready:

- Push your branch to GitHub
- Click **"Compare & pull request"**
- Give it a clear title
- Describe what you did (and why, if helpful!)
- If it’s your first time, say hi! We love meeting new contributors ✨

Example:

> Added dark mode toggle in header. Used CSS variables and system preference detection. Let me know if you'd like me to tweak anything! 💅

We might ask for small changes or suggestions — it’s all part of the process. 😄

## 🧼 Code Style & Guidelines

We may include style guides depending on the project (e.g., Prettier, ESLint, Black, etc.). If you’re unsure, **just do your best** — we’ll help you if anything needs adjusting.

Common practices:
- Use clear, meaningful commit messages
- Leave helpful comments if your code is doing something non-obvious
- Keep pull requests small & focused (one "thing" at a time!)

## 🙋‍♀️ Beginner Friendly Tips

- Look for issues labeled `good first issue`, `help wanted`, or `beginner-friendly`
- Unsure where to start? Open an issue and say hi! We’ll help guide you
- Don’t worry about making mistakes — that’s how we learn 💜
