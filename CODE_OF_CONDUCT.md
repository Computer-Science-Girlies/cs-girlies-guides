# 💖 Code of Conduct

## Welcome to Computer Science Girlies 👩💻!

We’re committed to providing a welcoming and inclusive environment for everyone — regardless of background, identity, or experience level.

All contributors, maintainers, and participants are expected to follow this code of conduct.

---

## 💛 Be Kind and Respectful

- Treat everyone with respect.
- No harassment, hate speech, discrimination, or personal attacks.
- We value kindness, empathy, and encouragement — especially for beginners.

---

## 🧠 Assume Positive Intent

- We're all here to learn.
- Mistakes are okay! Help others grow.
- If someone says or does something wrong, gently educate — **don’t shame**.

---

## 🙅‍♀️ What’s Not Okay (AT ALL)

- Any form of discrimination or exclusion
- Offensive comments related to gender, race, sexual orientation, disability, or religion
- Bullying or belittling others
- Gatekeeping ("you’re not a real dev if...")

---

## 💬 Reporting Issues

If someone violates this code, or makes you feel uncomfortable:

1. You can report privately to a maintainer.
2. Or reach out via Discord (admins/mods will help)

Your safety and comfort are a priority. Reports will be handled respectfully and confidentially.

## 💫 Let’s Build Together

We’re not just coding — we’re building community.  
Thanks for making this a safe, inclusive, and encouraging place for everyone.
